The experience really opened my eyes to how airlines are evolving beyond just flying planes - AirAsia is basically becoming a tech company too! Their SuperApp is pretty impressive, handling everything from online banking to grocery shopping, which is way more than I initially expected from an airline company.
What really stood out to me was how they're looking for different types of tech roles. Before this, I might have thought airlines only needed pilots and flight attendants, but they've got positions for everything from frontend developers to data scientists. It's cool to see how they're embracing digital transformation.
I also appreciate how they're upfront about the work-from-home challenges for junior engineers. It's refreshing to see a company acknowledge these difficulties rather than pretending everything's perfect. Plus, the three-month minimum commitment for internships seems pretty reasonable - it's enough time to actually learn something meaningful.
The whole experience has shown me that the aviation industry is much more diverse and tech-focused than I imagined. It's not just about flying people around anymore - it's about creating entire digital ecosystems. Pretty eye-opening stuff!
